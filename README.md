The c++ code files that have the 2-11-20 date label included in the name are for the coding assignment 2. 
This is not created using the command prompt as it is kinda confusing and have not had time to get to trying that yet
but I will be trying soon, this is created using the online structure provided. I also did not answer the written answer for 
question 3 since I do not know or really understand what is happening in the memory when vectors are created in c++.
